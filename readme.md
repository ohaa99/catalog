# Item Catalog Projoct. 
This is 2nd project for item catalog for the the  full stack nano degree.
I have created a simple Training Centers Guide project in order to practice  the following Skills.

- Working with CRUD
- Making a WebServer
- Working with flask framework
- Using social media sign in with your project
 
## SETUP
1. Download Install Virtualbox. You can Download it from 
    [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1)
2. Download and Install vagrant to connect to the virtual machine with your host machine
    [Download vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. ```cd``` into the project folder and launch vagrant. You can copy this command to your terminal.
4.  Use  ```vagrant up``` command. This will install the virtual machine , python and all other dependencies needed for this project to work. (It will take some time depending on your internet connection speed .)
5. Login to the virtual machine ```vagrant ssh```.
6. Run ``` python /vagrant/tcsGuide/app.py  ```

NOW you are up and running
